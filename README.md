Project Environment Setup

Node and Express Environment

For this project, we utilize the Node and Express environments. Ensure that Node and Express are installed on the local machine. The project file server.js should require express(), and an instance of the app should be created using Express.

The Express app instance should be directed to the project folder containing .html, .css, and .js files.

Project Dependencies

Install the 'cors' package in the project through the command line. Require the 'cors' package in the project file server.js. Set up the app instance to use cors(). Install the body-parser package and include it in the project. Local Server

Make sure that the local server is up and running. It should provide feedback to the Command Line through a functional callback function.

API Credentials

Generate API credentials from OpenWeatherMap.com or utilize an existing API key within the application.
